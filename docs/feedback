[*]The cashflow seems alot less than expected - is it using P&I instead of IO?
[*]Also, the LMI field doesnt seem to work, i put in a value but after pressing the submit button it goes back to zero. It should also be deductible over the first 5 years.
[*]It seems odd with having ATO as a negative amount - does this mean we're paying tax as opposed to getting a tax refund?
[*]Is depreciation calculated?
[*]It'd be handy if there was a column in the table for out of pocket amount (whether that be a positive or negative figure based on the calcs), seems like its in the graph but not in the table

Hi,

This is a great thread! I dream of a super model that would:

1) predict how a portfolio of multiple properties will grow in value
2) examines my serviceability and predicts when I can afford the next property
3) works out my expected income tax liability from year to year

This super model would cater for such variables as:

1) properties bought in different years (in the past and expected in the future) bought on specific dates
2) variations in income tax scales from year to year
3) P&I loans and I/O loans and switching between them, fixed interest loans, variable interest loans
4) adjusting loan interest rates from year to year
5) multiple loans for each property
6) adjusting salary percentage increases from year to year
7) adjusting rent percentage increases from year to year
8) adjusting superannuation contribution rates from year to year
9) adjusting cost increases from year to year
10) works out purchase costs (both property and loan depending on the state)
11) allows for initial cash deposits on propertiews
12) allows for entry of real information (eg from depreciation schedules, tax returns etc which overrides derived or predicted data
13) income from different sources (wages, rents, shares etc)
14) variable capital growth rates for different properties and the ability to vary the capital growth rate from year to year to allow for cycles

Now that's a challenge

I have been using Money beans and have been reasonably happy with it, I do have a couple of problems... My IO loans come out at the end of each month, but some months have 30 days and other 31, so my IO is never the same. I can not find a way to change this in money beans.
Also, I wanted to put the PPor in there as well just for interest sake, but we pay fortnightly and there is no option for that either... 

Does anyone know of a software program that will automatically pick up the fact that it's a 31day month?? Or the fortnightly payments??

My trial of money beans is nearly over, so i need to know if it is posible to fix my questions before i purchase it.

Thanks again... MM
